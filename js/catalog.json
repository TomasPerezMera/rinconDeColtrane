It was assembled from two separate sessions at the studio of Rudy Van Gelder in Hackensack, New Jersey in 1958. As Coltrane's fame grew during the 1960s long after he had stopped recording for the label, Prestige used unissued recordings to create new marketable albums without Coltrane's input or approval."

Critic Gene Lees stated that the quartet had never played the tunes before: 'They arrived with music-store sheet music of the songs' Lees said; 'They were not 'standards' or tunes that they knew, and I think it tells you a lot about John that he chose to do that. The music was a complete departure from anything that had gone before.'"
